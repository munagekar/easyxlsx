Easy XlsxWriter : Wrapper around xlsxwriter module in python

xlsxwriter spreadsheet class doesn't have its own pointer giving rise to this project.
Easy Xlsxwriter aims to provide access to spreadsheets along with a pointer so that more can be done in less.
And Python Loops can be kept clean


# Note

Most features of xlsxwriter will not be supported by this wrapper. If you want flexiblity stick the original library.

# Design Principles
- Limit exposure to xlsxwriter
- Provide File Pointer like control over Worksheets
- Code : Python PEP 8
- Highly reusable for basic tasks.
